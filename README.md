# About

This project has been created only in learning purposes. I know that the code doesn't look great but this is the main purpose of mine. I am learning and I just wanted to create a website where I could create some stuff using HTML, CSS and especially JavaScript. 
This website doesn't matter for people who doesn't interested in JavaScript. For others, you may use my pieces of code if you want to. Thanks.
